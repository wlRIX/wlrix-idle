//! `SIGHUP` means "re-read the config" and `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` mean "stop". Both are turned into
//! a calloop [`Ping`] fired from the handler -- an eventfd write, which is async-signal-safe --
//! whose source on the event loop does the actual work, where it can touch the Wayland
//! connection and the config without racing anything.
//!
//! Stopping matters more here than in most daemons. This process is what switched the monitors

//! leaves a blank a client asked for alone, so no keypress will undo it. Dying on the default
//! disposition would leave a session running behind dark screens with no way back. So the
//! signal has to reach the loop, which un-blanks on its way out.
